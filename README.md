# POC for App Builder Template Registry


## Adding a template to the Template Registry
1. Create an issue with "Template Review Request" type.
2. Provide GitHub and NPM links.
3. This will trigger a workflow that verifies the template.
4. If verification passed, template will be added to `registry.json` file that serves as a simple storage and the issue will be closed.
5. If verification failed, a comment will be added to the issue.
